# Technical Architecture

### Overview

JuChain is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered to serve as an on-chain traffic hub and user growth engine. Its technical architecture is designed for rapid transaction confirmations, low costs, and high throughput while maintaining decentralization and security. Powered by the proprietary **JPoSA (JuChain Proof of Stake Authorization)** consensus mechanism and full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), JuChain offers developers an efficient and familiar environment. This document outlines JuChain’s core technical architecture, including key components, consensus mechanisms, and network design.

### Architecture Layers

JuChain’s technical stack is organized into distinct layers, each handling specific functions:

#### 1. Data Layer

* **Purpose**: Stores all blockchain data.
* **Key Components**:
  * **Blocks**: Include headers (timestamp, previous block hash, Merkle root) and transaction data.
  * **State Database**: Uses Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) to store account balances and contract states.
  * **Transaction Pool**: Buffers pending transactions for packaging.
* **Features**: Enables fast queries and ensures data integrity.

#### 2. Network Layer

* **Purpose**: Manages node communication and data syncing.
* **Key Components**:
  * **P2P Network**: Peer-to-peer protocol for node discovery and data propagation.
  * **Node Types**: Full nodes (complete data), light nodes (headers only), and validator nodes.
* **Features**: Efficiently broadcasts transactions and blocks.

#### 3. Consensus Layer

* **Purpose**: Maintains network state consistency.
* **Core Mechanism**: JPoSA (detailed below).
* **Features**: 1-second block time for swift confirmations.

#### 4. Execution Layer

* **Purpose**: Processes transactions and smart contracts.
* **Key Components**:
  * **EVM**: Supports Solidity smart contracts.
  * **Gas Mechanism**: Ultra-low transaction fees.
* **Features**: Compatible with Ethereum tools and contracts.

#### 5. Application Layer

* **Purpose**: Provides developer interfaces.
* **Key Components**:
  * **JSON-RPC API**: Enables Web3.js interaction.
  * **Tools**: Developer portal, traffic analytics dashboard.
* **Features**: Simplifies dApp development and integration.

### JPoSA Consensus Mechanism

JPoSA is JuChain’s flagship consensus mechanism, blending Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA) for efficiency and security.

#### Core Design

* **Validator Structure**:
  * **Core Validators**: Up to 21, tasked with block production.
  * **Standby Validators**: Ready to replace faulty core validators.
  * **Candidate Validators**: Compete by staking JU tokens.
* **Staking Mechanism**:
  * Users stake JU tokens to become validators or delegate to existing ones.
* **Block Production**:
  * Core validators take turns generating blocks every 1 second.

#### Performance Metrics

* **Block Time**: 1 second
* **Transaction Confirmation**: 2-3 seconds (2-3 blocks)
* **Throughput**: Thousands of transactions per second (varies with network load and optimization)
* **Fault Tolerance**: Tolerates up to 1/3 core validator failures (max 7)

#### Security

* **Voting Weight**: Adjusted based on stake amount and validator track record.
* **Penalty System**: Malicious actions or downtime result in slashed JU stakes.

### Network Structure

JuChain leverages a decentralized P2P network with multiple node roles.

#### Node Types

1. **Full Nodes**:
   * Store the entire blockchain and validate all transactions.
   * Ideal for developers or high-reliability needs.
2. **Light Nodes**:
   * Sync only block headers, relying on full nodes for data.
   * Perfect for resource-constrained devices.
3. **Validator Nodes**:
   * Participate in JPoSA consensus, requiring JU staking and uptime.

#### Data Synchronization

* **Block Propagation**: New blocks spread quickly via P2P.
* **State Sync**: New nodes update incrementally from the latest state.

***

### Core Components

#### 1. JU Token

* **Uses**:
  * Pays transaction Gas fees.
  * Staked for consensus and governance.
* **Features**: Secures the network and fuels ecosystem incentives.

#### 2. Block Structure

* **Header**:
  * Timestamp, previous block hash, Merkle root, validator signature.
* **Body**:
  * Transaction list (transfers and contract calls).
* **Size**: Default 2 MB, adjustable as needed.

#### 3. State Database

* **Implementation**: Based on MPT for accounts and contract data.
* **Features**: Fast read/write, optimized for state queries.

***

### Performance Highlights

JuChain’s design optimizes these key metrics:

* **Fast Blocks**: 1-second block time suits high-frequency trading and real-time apps.
* **Low Costs**: Gas fees far below Ethereum, averaging under 0.001 JU.
* **High Throughput**: Parallel processing handles heavy concurrency.
* **EVM Compatibility**: Supports Ethereum contracts and tools with zero learning curve.

### Developer Integration

#### 1. RPC Interface

* **Endpoint**: `https://testnet-rpc.juchain.org`
*   **Example** (Query block height):

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' https://testnet-rpc.juchain.org
    ```
*   **Response**:

    ```json
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x1a2b3c"}
    ```

#### 2. Network Config

* **Testnet**:
  * RPC: `https://testnet-rpc.juchain.org`
  * Chain ID: 202599
  * Currency: JU
* **Gas Settings**:
  * Minimum Gas Price: 1 gwei
  * Transaction Gas Limit: 5,500,000

#### 3. Tool Support

* **Frameworks**: Truffle, Hardhat
* **Block Explorer**: `https://explorer-testnet.juchain.org`

### Comparison with Other Blockchains

| **Feature**           | **JuChain** | **Ethereum**  | **BNB Chain** |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Consensus**         | JPoSA       | PoS           | PoSA          |
| **Block Time**        | 1 second    | 12-15 seconds | 3 seconds     |
| **Transaction Cost**  | < 0.001 JU  | High          | Medium        |
| **EVM Compatibility** | Yes         | Yes           | Yes           |

JuChain shines in block speed and cost efficiency.
