# 4.7 JuChain Partner Nodes

Partner Nodes are strategic allies in the JuChain ecosystem, receiving 10% of the daily token emission (7,200 JU) to drive ecosystem growth and user adoption.

## Admission Criteria

Partner Node status is granted only to entities that meet strict requirements:

* Significant industry resources
* Strategic value to the JuChain ecosystem
* Alignment with JuChain's vision
* Passing JuChain's rigorous assessment standards

## Emission Distribution Mechanism

The allocation of tokens among Partner Nodes is based on measurable contributions to the ecosystem:

* An on-chain oracle aggregates unique active addresses and transaction volume each month
* Traffic contribution is measured and verified through transparent metrics
* Each Partner Node receives a proportional share of the 7,200 JU daily pool based on their contribution

## Key Obligations

Partner Nodes must fulfill several important responsibilities to maintain their status:

* Maintain a validator or archival node with 99.9% uptime
* Apply mandatory upgrades within seven days of release
* Lock a minimum self-stake of 50,000 JU to guarantee economic alignment
* Host quarterly community workshops or AMAs to onboard new users and developers
* Submit audited traffic metrics and security reports to the Foundation

## Incentive Package

In addition to the base token emission, Partner Nodes receive several benefits:

* Up to a 2% bonus emission for exceeding predefined traffic growth thresholds
* Priority placement on the official JuChain Dapp portal and marketing campaigns
* Eligibility for co-marketing grants and strategic investment from the Foundation

## Accountability Measures

To ensure ongoing value creation, Partner Nodes are subject to review:

* The Foundation reviews Partner status annually
* If a node fails to meet its commitments, the community may vote to reduce its emission or remove it
* Performance metrics are publicly available for community scrutiny
* New Partner Node applications are subject to community governance approval

This structured approach ensures that Partner Nodes remain aligned with JuChain's goals as the ultimate chain traffic hub, directing users to valuable applications in the ecosystem.
