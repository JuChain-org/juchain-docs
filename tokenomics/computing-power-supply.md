# Computing Power Supply

JU Computer Power represents the primary mechanism for JU token distribution, accounting for 80% of the daily token emission (57,600 JU). This section details the Computing process, supply structure, and halving schedule.

## Computing Power Supply Principles

The Computing Power Supply system is designed with several key principles in mind:

1. **Fair Distribution**: Supply are distributed based on computing power contribution
2. **Long-term Sustainability**: Halving mechanism ensures sustainable token economics
3. **Predictable Supply**: Daily automatic distribution provides consistent incentives
4. **Proportional Allocation**: Supply scale with individual contribution to network security

## Halving Schedule

To ensure long-term token value preservation and gradually reduced inflation, JuChain implements a halving schedule:

* **Frequency**: Daily Supply halve every 4 years
* **Formula**: Each halving reduces by 50% of the previous amount
* **Impact**: Creates scarcity over time while maintaining incentives for early participants

## **Supply** Distribution

Computing Power Supply are distributed according to a clear and transparent mechanism:

* **Calculation Basis**: Pro-rata by computing power
*   **Formula**:

    ```
    Daily Output = (Personal Computing Power / Total Computing Power of the Day) Ã— 57,600
    ```
* **Settlement**: Automatic daily supply calculation and distribution
* **Transparency**: All distributions recorded on-chain for verification

## Strategic Importance

The computing power structure plays several critical roles in JuChain's ecosystem:

1. Ensures wide token distribution among active network participants
2. Creates economic incentives for maintaining network security
3. Gradually introduces new tokens into circulation in proportion to network growth
4. Supply early adopters while maintaining long-term sustainability
5. Establishes a predictable supply curve that participants can plan around
