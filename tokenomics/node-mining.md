# 4.5 Node Mining

Node mining represents the primary mechanism for JU token distribution, accounting for 80% of the daily token emission (57,600 JU). This section details the mining process, reward structure, and halving schedule.

## Mining Principles

The node mining system is designed with several key principles in mind:

1. **Fair Distribution**: Rewards are distributed based on computing power contribution
2. **Long-term Sustainability**: Halving mechanism ensures sustainable token economics
3. **Predictable Rewards**: Daily automatic distribution provides consistent incentives
4. **Proportional Allocation**: Rewards scale with individual contribution to network security

## Halving Schedule

To ensure long-term token value preservation and gradually reduced inflation, JuChain implements a halving schedule:

* **Frequency**: Rewards halve every 4 years
* **Formula**: Each halving reduces rewards by 50% of the previous amount
* **Impact**: Creates scarcity over time while maintaining incentives for early participants

## Reward Distribution

Node mining rewards are distributed according to a clear and transparent mechanism:

* **Calculation Basis**: Pro-rata by computing power
*   **Formula**:

    ```
    Daily Output = (Personal Computing Power / Total Computing Power of the Day) Ã— 57,600
    ```
* **Settlement**: Automatic daily reward calculation and distribution
* **Transparency**: All distributions recorded on-chain for verification

## Strategic Importance

The node mining structure plays several critical roles in JuChain's ecosystem:

1. Ensures wide token distribution among active network participants
2. Creates economic incentives for maintaining network security
3. Gradually introduces new tokens into circulation in proportion to network growth
4. Rewards early adopters while maintaining long-term sustainability
5. Establishes a predictable supply curve that participants can plan around
