# Node Computing Power and Income

This section explains how computing power is calculated for nodes and how this translates into daily income from mining rewards.

## Computing Power Calculation

As the network grows, the computing power required for new nodes increases exponentially. When the total number of nodes reaches 3,000, the computing power (T) of a node bought on day n is calculated using the formula:

```
T_n = 1000 × (1.02)^n
```

Where:

* T\_n is the computing power (T) of a node bought on day n
* Each day, the required computing power increases by 2%

This exponential growth model:

* Rewards early participants
* Reflects the increasing difficulty as the network matures
* Creates scarcity in node positions over time

## Daily Income Calculation

The daily income for node operators is determined by their proportional contribution to the total network computing power:

```
Daily Output = (Personal Computing Power / Total Computing Power of the Day) × 57,600
```

This formula ensures that:

* Rewards are directly proportional to computing power contribution
* All 57,600 daily JU mining tokens are distributed
* Participants receive fair compensation for their resources
* Rewards adjust automatically as network participation changes

## Example Calculation

For illustration purposes:

1. If a node operator bought a node on day 100:
   * Their computing power would be: 1000 × (1.02)^100 ≈ 7,244.6 T
2. If the total network computing power on that day is 1,000,000 T:
   * Their daily output would be: (7,244.6 / 1,000,000) × 57,600 ≈ 417.3 JU
3. As more nodes join the network, the proportion will decrease, but the absolute value of each node remains constant or increases with time

## Strategic Implications

This computing power and income model creates several important dynamics:

* Early adopters receive proportionally higher rewards
* Node operators are incentivized for long-term participation
* Network security increases over time as more computing power is added
* The system naturally balances between rewarding early adopters and maintaining attractive returns for new participants
