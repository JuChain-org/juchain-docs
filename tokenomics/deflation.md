# Deflation

JuChain implements several deflationary mechanisms to ensure long-term token value preservation and balance the continuous token emission.

## Buyback Mechanism

When 20% of the total supply enters circulation, JuChain activates its primary deflationary mechanism:

* 20% of quarterly profits are used to buy back JU tokens from the open market
* All purchased tokens are permanently burned (removed from circulation)
* This process continues until the supply reaches 50% of the original total

This systematic reduction in supply:

* Creates consistent buying pressure
* Counteracts inflationary effects of emissions
* Benefits all token holders through reduced supply
* Establishes a predictable deflationary schedule

This comprehensive approach to deflation ensures that JuChain's tokenomics remain sustainable over the long term, balancing the needs for ongoing rewards with the preservation of token value.
