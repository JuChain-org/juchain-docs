# Supply Dynamics

To preserve long-term scarcity while supporting sustainable growth, JuChain employs a dual mechanism of controlled issuance and scheduled halvings.

## Genesis Supply and Circulation

* **Genesis Supply:** 210,000,000 JU (100%) are minted at Token Generation Event (TGE)
* **Initial Circulation:** 3% (6,300,000 JU) circulate immediately via the Initial Offering
* **Locked Supply:** The remaining 97% are released via Computer power and ecosystem programs

## Daily Emission Curve

* **Initial Daily Output:** 72,000 JU
*   **Halving Schedule:** Every fourth year, the emission rate halves, following the formula:

    ```
    O_n = O_0/2^(n/4)
    ```

    Where:

    * O\_n is output in year n
    * O\_0 is initial output

## Projected Supply Growth

Under the halving model, circulating supply is expected to follow this trajectory:

* **Year 4:** 36,000 JU Daily
* **Year 8:** 18,000 JU Daily
* **Year 12:** 9,000 JU Daily
* **By analogy, Daily supply is halved every 4 year**\


## Strategic Importance

This controlled emission schedule ensures that:

1. Token supply remains predictable
2. Early adopters are rewarded
3. Long-term supply is capped to preserve value
4. Emission rate adjusts to network maturity
