# Distribution Plan

JuChain's token distribution is designed to balance immediate utility with long-term sustainability. The distribution plan reflects the project's commitment to building a robust and widely-used blockchain ecosystem.

## High-Level Token Allocation

The initial distribution of JU tokens is structured as follows:

| Category                        | Allocation |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Node Mining                     | 97%        |
| Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) | 3%         |

This distribution structure emphasizes:

1. **Community-Driven Growth**: The vast majority of tokens (97%) are allocated to node mining, ensuring wide distribution and community participation over time.
2. **Minimal Pre-Sale**: Only a small portion (3%) is allocated to the Initial Exchange Offering, preventing concentration of ownership in early investors.
3. **Earned Distribution**: Most tokens enter circulation through active participation in network security and operations, rather than through pre-sale allocations.
4. **Long-Term Alignment**: The gradual release of tokens through mining aligns token distribution with network growth and usage.

## Strategic Rationale

This distribution approach is strategically designed to:

* Prevent excessive token concentration in few hands
* Ensure fair opportunity for all participants to acquire JU tokens
* Support gradual, organic price discovery
* Align token distribution with actual network participation and growth
* Create sustainable token economics that can support JuChain's long-term vision as a chain traffic hub
