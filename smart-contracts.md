# Smart Contracts

JuChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means developers can easily deploy and run smart contracts written in Solidity. This document will guide you through the basics of smart contract development on JuChain.

### Contract Development

#### Development Environment

To develop smart contracts on JuChain, you'll need:

1. A code editor (e.g., VSCode, Remix)
2. Solidity compiler
3. Web3 development framework (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle)
4. JuChain RPC endpoint

#### Contract Deployment

You can deploy your smart contracts to JuChain using:

1. Remix IDE (connecting to JuChain network)
2. Hardhat or Truffle deployment scripts
3. Direct interaction with Web3 libraries

### Best Practices

When developing smart contracts on JuChain:

1. Always test your contracts thoroughly
2. Follow security best practices
3. Optimize for gas efficiency
4. Use latest stable Solidity version
5. Implement proper access controls

### Contract Verification

After deployment, you can verify your contract source code on JuChain's block explorer for transparency and security.
