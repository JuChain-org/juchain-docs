#### What is the JuChain Testnet Faucet?

The JuChain Testnet Faucet is a developer-friendly tool that dispenses small amounts of testnet tokens (JU) for use on the JuChain Testnet. These tokens are for testing purposes only, hold no real-world value, and can be used to cover Gas fees, deploy smart contracts, or interact with DApps.
