#### A Platform for Building Innovative Applications

JuChain is a global on-chain ecosystem composed of developers, users, and enterprises, dedicated to creating next-generation open internet applications. It enables developers to:

* Focus on solving real user problems
* Support global-scale application deployment by default

As a Layer 3 solution, JuChain inherits the security of OP Mainnet while providing better performance and lower costs. This means anyone can build and use applications on JuChain.

JuChain is becoming an incubator for innovative use cases in media, entertainment, social, and even AI sectors. As a nurturing ground for innovation, JuChain enables developers to focus on improving their products while retaining more benefits.

#### Limitations of Traditional App Distribution

Traditional app distribution models typically require developers to pay 30% platform fees. These platforms may:

* Encourage predatory behavior (selling user data)
* Require excessive personal information
* Arbitrarily restrict or deny access
* Have geographical restrictions

In contrast, decentralized applications on JuChain allow users from anywhere in the world to access services directly through their phones, opening unprecedented opportunities.

#### Complete Developer Tools

Developers choose JuChain because of:

* 24/7 global payment channels
* Extremely low transaction costs (typically below $0.001)
* Powerful development toolchain

With a rich toolkit (mostly open source), JuChain applications can go from development to launch within hours. We're revitalizing the spirit of innovation, enabling small teams to create great products.

Core tools making this possible include:

* Developer platform: Providing professional on-chain development services, such as free nodes, sponsored transactions, etc.
* Verification services: Offering unique experiences for authenticated users

#### Ecosystem Support

More applications mean more users joining the ecosystem. JuChain is committed to promoting quality applications through multiple channels to expand the developer and user community. We actively distribute applications through official channels, including wallets, social media, and other platforms.

In addition to promotional support, JuChain also provides generous economic incentives. We use a portion of our revenue to support public goods and ecosystem projects.
