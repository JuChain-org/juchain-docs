This will walk you through the steps of setting up and configuring a MetaMask wallet with Juchain.

**NOTE:** It is recommended that you set this up through Chrome.

#### Step 1 - Install MetaMask[â€‹](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/connect-to-berachain#step-1-install-metamask) <a href="#step-1-install-metamask" id="step-1-install-metamask"></a>

Go to MetaMask's [website](https://metamask.io/) and click to download the browser extension for your browser of choice. Make sure the extension is being offered by `metamask.io`.

#### Step 2 - Create Your Wallet in MetaMask[â€‹](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/connect-to-berachain#step-2-create-your-wallet-in-metamask) <a href="#step-2-create-your-wallet-in-metamask" id="step-2-create-your-wallet-in-metamask"></a>

Once MetaMask finishes installing as a Chrome extension, the initial prompt will show up. Click the `Create a new wallet` button to start the process.

This will ask you to first set a password. This is the password you will enter when you open up the MetaMask extension:

Next, follow the instructions to secure your wallet phrase. This step is very important as the wallet phrase is what is used to prove that you own the assets in your wallet.

#### Step 2: Add JuChain Mainnet

1. Click the network selection dropdown menu in the top left of MetaMask
2. Click "Add Custom Network"
3. Fill in the following network information and click save:
   * Network Name: JuChain Mainnet
   * RPC URL: https://rpc.juchain.org
   * Chain ID: 210000
   * Currency Symbol: JU
   * Block Explorer: [http://juscan.io](http://testnet.juscan.io)
4. JuChain also provides an automatic network addition solution for MetaMask wallet - simply visit the JuChain testnet website testnet.juchain.org and click "Add Network" to complete the addition.

#### Step 3: Get Test Tokens

1. Visit the faucet website: http://faucet-testnet.juchain.org/
2. Copy your MetaMask wallet address (0x...)\

3. Paste your wallet address into the input box
4. Click the "Get Test Tokens" button
5. Wait a few seconds, and the test tokens will be automatically sent to your wallet

#### Common Issues

1. If network addition fails, check:
   * Network parameters are entered correctly
   * Network connection is stable
   * MetaMask is up to date
2. If unable to get test tokens:
   * Ensure wallet address is copied correctly
   * Each address has a daily claim limit
   * Try again later
3. If balance is not visible:
   * Ensure you've switched to JuChain Testnet network
   * Click the refresh button in MetaMask
   * Check network connection

#### Important Notes

1. This is a test network, do not store large amounts of assets
2. Test tokens are for testing purposes only and have no real value
3. If you encounter issues, seek help through the community
