# Quick Understanding of JuChain

## 1. What is JuChain

JuChain is a decentralized ecosystem infrastructure developed and launched by JuCoin Exchange, built on OP-Stack, aiming to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly EVM-compatible network. JuChain adopts a Layer 3 (L3) architecture, built on top of the OP network, inheriting Ethereum's security while providing enhanced scalability, bringing a smoother on-chain experience for developers and users.

## 2. JuChain's Vision

JuChain's goal is:

**To help more people easily enter the blockchain world and enjoy a secure and efficient on-chain experience**

We hope to:

• Enhance blockchain transaction experience and reduce user costs through optimized L3 solutions;

• Provide comprehensive development tools and infrastructure for developers to build DApps more conveniently;

• Leverage the JuCoin ecosystem to provide funding, traffic, and market support for projects, accelerating innovative application deployment.
