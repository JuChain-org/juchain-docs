### JuChain Developer Docs - Community & Support

Welcome to the JuChain developer community! Whether you’re just starting out or already building complex dApps, we’re here to support you every step of the way. This section covers how to get help, join community discussions, and contribute to the JuChain ecosystem. With these resources, you can solve problems faster, share insights, and help shape JuChain’s future.

***

#### 1. Getting Support

Running into issues during development? Here’s how to get assistance. We recommend starting with self-help resources before reaching out to the community or official support.

**1.1 Self-Help Resources**

* **Developer Docs**\
  Your go-to resource, packed with guides from beginner basics to advanced development. For questions about smart contracts, APIs, or traffic finance, check the _Getting Started_ and _Developer Guide_ sections.
* **Block Explorer**\
  Track transaction statuses or verify contract deployments on the JuChain Testnet Explorer: `https://testnet-explorer.juchain.org`.
* **API Status Page**\
  Confirm if RPC and API services are up and running: `https://status.juchain.org` (TODO).

**1.2 Official Support**

* **Tech Support Email**\
  For tricky issues or when you need official help, email `support@juch Esto ain.org`. To speed things up, include:
  * Problem description
  * Relevant transaction hash or contract address
  * Error logs (if any)
  * Expected vs. actual behavior
* **Response Time**\
  Typically within 24 hours on weekdays. For urgent issues, flag them in community channels for faster attention.

**1.3 Community Support**

The community is JuChain’s heartbeat, with tons of developers ready to lend a hand.

* **Discord Community**\
  Join the official Discord server (`https://discord.gg/juchain`) and dive into these channels:
  * `#dev-help`: Tech troubleshooting
  * `#general`: Casual chats
  * `#announcements`: Official updates
* **Twitter/X**\
  Follow `@JuChain101`—DM or tweet your questions to connect with the team.

#### 2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are answers to common developer queries. If your question isn’t covered, ask away in the community!

**2.1 Development**

* **Q: Why is my transaction stuck in pending?**\
  A: Check if your Gas fee is sufficient (stick to the default if unsure) or if the RPC node is working (`https://testnet-rpc.juchain.org`). Still stuck? Share the transaction hash in Discord’s `#dev-help`.
* **Q: How do I get more testnet JU tokens?**\
  A: Hit up the faucet at `https://faucet.juchain.org`. Need more? Email support with your use case.
* **Q: What dev tools does JuChain support?**\
  A: JuChain is fully EVM-compatible, so you can use Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, and ethers.js/Web3.js. See the _Getting Started_ guide for details.

**2.2 Traffic Finance & Ecosystem**

* **Q: How is traffic finance revenue calculated?**\
  A: It’s based on user activity and traffic analytics, defined by your smart contract logic. Check _Developer Guide - Traffic Finance Integration_.
* **Q: How does my dApp tap into ecosystem traffic?**\
  A: Register and link your contract address on the developer portal (`https://dev.juchain.org`) to unlock traffic allocation.
* **Q: What’s the process for ecosystem incentives?**\
  A: Apply at `grants@juchain.org` with a project overview and expected user scale. Review takes 2-4 weeks.

**2.3 Network & Consensus**

* **Q: What’s JPoSA’s block time?**\
  A: Averages 3 seconds, with final confirmations in 2-3 seconds. See _Introduction - JPoSA Consensus_.
* **Q: How do I become a validator?**\
  A: Stake enough JU (exact amount TBD) and run a node. Details in _Tutorials & Examples_ (coming soon).
